"""
Module implementing a second order approximation for groups of data-points, where
pairwise interactions of how holding out one sample affects another in the group
that's being held out are now taken into account. This method was originally
presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00418 and it is supposed to greatly improve
the accuracy of the influence estimations for big groups of data.

Disclaimer: this method can be very computationally expensive, especially when calculating
the influence for a large number of weights.

class SecondOrderInfluenceCalculator(BaseGroupInfluenceCalculator):
    """
    A class implementing the necessary methods to compute the different influence quantities
    (only for groups) using a second-order approximation, thus allowing us to take into
    account the pairwise interactions between points inside the group. For small groups of
    points, consider using the first order alternative if the computational cost is
    too high.

    Notes
    -----
    The methods currently implemented are available to evaluate groups of points:
    - Influence function vectors: the weights difference when removing groups of points.
    - Influence values/Cook's distance: a measure of reliance of the model on the group of points.

    This implementation is based on the following paper:
    [https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00418](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00418)

    Parameters
    ----------
    model
        The TF2.X model implementing the InfluenceModel interface.
    dataset
        A batched TF dataset containing the training dataset over which we will estimate the
        inverse-hessian-vector product.
    ihvp_calculator
        Either a string containing the IHVP method ('exact' or 'cgd'), an IHVPCalculator
        object or an InverseHessianVectorProduct object.
    n_samples_for_hessian
        An integer indicating the amount of samples to take from the provided train dataset.
    shuffle_buffer_size
        An integer indicating the buffer size of the train dataset's shuffle operation -- when
        choosing the amount of samples for the hessian.
